                        Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time was announced earlier this year and launches today,
                        October 2, 2020 on PS4 and Xbox One. The fourth mainline Crash game marks the return of
                        the mascot platforming franchise and is available both digitally and physically.

                        Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time picks up after the end of the third game,
                            Crash Bandicoot: Warped--villains Neo Cortex, Dr. N. Tropy, and Uka Uka are
                            back and planning an all-out assault on the entire multiverse. Crash and his
                            younger sister Coco must reunite four quantum masks and "bend the rules of reality"
                            to save the day. The masks help you through tricky areas, including a Time Mask
                            that can slow time and a Gravity Mask that lets you move upside down.
                            Crash Bandicoot 4 has the same platforming mechanics but with modern additions
                            like wall-running and rail-grinding. You can also play as Neo Cortex in addition
                            to Crash and Coco.
